v2009.08 - DUB-1.6.0.3, released on 2013/06/27
	- Platforms renamed: Historically, platforms were divided into
	  wireless (e.g.: ccwmx51js) and non-wireless (e.g.: ccmx51js).
	  To simplify code and maintenance these have been merged into only
	  one platform (e.g.: ccimx51js). A configuration option allows to
	  build U-Boot with legacy names (this will be the default behavior
	  to avoid problems with manufacturing scripts). Additionally, the
	  environment variable 'legacynames' [yes|no] will allow to change
	  between legacy names and new names.
	- Added support for Fusion 7" display selection on ccardimx28js.
	- Fix ccimx53js modules not booting when cameras were connected to
	  the JSK board.
	- Pass the following parameters to Linux in the bootargs for Yocto
	  rootfs:
	    - Ethernet/Wireless/Bluetooth MAC addresses
	    - wdmode (for wireless module)
	- Dynamic calculation of 'loadaddr' (the address in RAM where files
	  are transferred) depending on available RAM and U-Boot load address
	  to allow the maximum possible file size transfers.
	  NOTE: Requires a reset of previously existing 'loadaddr' with:
	      # setenv loadaddr
	      # saveenv
	- Added new ccardimx28js variants 0x0e..0x12


v2009.08 - DUB-1.5.2.1, released on 2013/03/15

v2009.08 - DUB-1.5.1.3, released on 2013/02/19
	- Fix intermittent hang during TFTP on ccxmx53js.

	  available RAM memory, to allow loading kernels bigger
	  than 64MiB.
	- Fix bug when using large filename paths

	- Added 'fbprimary' variable to select the display to be used as
	  primary interface.
	- Added 'btaddr' variable in NVRAM to hold Bluetooth adapter
	  MAC address.
	- 'video' command extended to handle two custom LCD configurations,
	  which are saved into the NVRAM. These configurations are passed to
	  the kernel through the shared memory.
	- Added 'calibration' yes|no variable to pass (or not) the calibration
	  option to the kernel command line.
	- Added option to select the cc(w)mx51js variant in the U-Boot config,

	- Added LVDS display enable in configuration tool.
	- Added 'hostname' variable to store the device's hostname in NVRAM.
	  If this variable does not exist it is automatically generated out of

	  MAC address (ethaddr).  E.g. CCWMX51-123456.
