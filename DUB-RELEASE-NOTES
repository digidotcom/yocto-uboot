v2009.08 - DUB-1.6.0.3, released on 2013/06/27
	- Platforms renamed: Historically, platforms were divided into
	  wireless (e.g.: ccwmx51js) and non-wireless (e.g.: ccmx51js).
	  To simplify code and maintenance these have been merged into only
	  one platform (e.g.: ccimx51js). A configuration option allows to
	  build U-Boot with legacy names (this will be the default behavior
	  to avoid problems with manufacturing scripts). Additionally, the
	  environment variable 'legacynames' [yes|no] will allow to change
	  between legacy names and new names.
	- Added support for Fusion 7" display selection on ccardimx28js.
	- Fix ccimx53js modules not booting when cameras were connected to
	  the JSK board.
	- Pass the following parameters to Linux in the bootargs for Yocto
	  rootfs:
	    - Ethernet/Wireless/Bluetooth MAC addresses
	    - wdmode (for wireless module)
	- Dynamic calculation of 'loadaddr' (the address in RAM where files
	  are transferred) depending on available RAM and U-Boot load address
	  to allow the maximum possible file size transfers.
	  NOTE: Requires a reset of previously existing 'loadaddr' with:
	      # setenv loadaddr
	      # saveenv
	- Added new ccardimx28js variants 0x0e..0x12


v2009.08 - DUB-1.5.2.1, released on 2013/03/15
	- Added ccxmx51 variant CC-MX-LC47-ZM-1

v2009.08 - DUB-1.5.1.3, released on 2013/02/19
	- Fix intermittent hang during TFTP on ccxmx53js.
	- Load address for WindowsCE images set depending on
	  available RAM memory, to allow loading kernels bigger
	  than 64MiB.

	- Added ConnectCard for i.MX28 platform support.
	- Added 'fbprimary' variable to select the display to be used as
	  primary interface.
	- Added 'btaddr' variable in NVRAM to hold Bluetooth adapter
	  MAC address.
	- 'video' command extended to handle two custom LCD configurations,
	  which are saved into the NVRAM. These configurations are passed to
	  the kernel through the shared memory.
	- Added 'calibration' yes|no variable to pass (or not) the calibration
	  option to the kernel command line.
	- Added option to select the cc(w)mx51js variant in the U-Boot config,

	- Added LVDS display enable in configuration tool.
	- Added 'hostname' variable to store the device's hostname in NVRAM.
	  If this variable does not exist it is automatically generated out of
	  the platform abbreviated name and the last three bytes of the first
	  MAC address (ethaddr).  E.g. CCWMX51-123456.
